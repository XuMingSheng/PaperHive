Kernel methods rely on the notion of similarity between points in a higher (possibly infinite) dimensional feature space. For machine learning, the notion of similarity assumes that points close in the feature space should be close in the machine learning task space. In this paper, we discuss the use of variational quantum kernels with task-specific quantum metric learning to generate optimal quantum embeddings (a.k.a. quantum feature encodings) that are specific to machine learning tasks. Such task-specific optimal quantum embeddings, implicitly supporting feature selection, are valuable not only to quantum kernel methods in improving the latter's performance, but they can also be valuable to non-kernel QML methods based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) as pretrained embeddings and for transfer learning. This further demonstrates the quantum utility, and quantum advantage (with classically-intractable quantum embeddings), of quantum kernel methods.",

Quantum machine learning methods have been employed to solve quantum many-body systems and have demonstrated accurate electronic structure calculations of lattice models, molecular systems, and recently periodic systems. A hybrid approach using restricted Boltzmann machines and a quantum algorithm to obtain the probability distribution that can be optimized classically is a promising method due to its efficiency and ease of implementation. Here we implement the benchmark test of the hybrid quantum machine learning on the IBM-Q quantum computer to calculate the electronic structure of typical 2-dimensional crystal structures: hexagonal-Boron Nitride and graphene. The band structures of these systems calculated using the hybrid quantum machine learning are in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional electronic structure calculation.

Machine learning represents an important field with broad applications where quantum computer may offer significant speedup. Several quantum algorithms for discriminative machine learning have been found based on efficient solving of linear algebraic problems, with potential exponential speedup in runtime under the assumption of effective input from a quantum random access memory. In machine learning, generative models represent another large class which is widely used for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is exponentially more powerful to represent probability distributions compared with classical generative models and has exponential speedup in training and inference at least for some instances under a reasonable assumption in computational complexity theory. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine learning and offers a remarkable example in which a quantum algorithm shows exponential improvement over any classical algorithm in an important application field.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. Many articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.",

We will explore the ways in which machine learning could benefit from new quantum technologies and algorithms to find new ways to speed up their computations by breakthroughs in physical hardware, as well as to improve existing models or devise new learning schemes in the quantum domain. Moreover, there are lots of experiments in quantum physics that do generate incredible amounts of data and machine learning would be a great tool to analyze those and make predictions, or even control the experiment itself. On top of that, data visualization techniques and other schemes borrowed from machine learning can be of great use to theoreticians to have better intuition on the structure of complex manifolds or to make predictions on theoretical models.

In the predominantly empirical realm of quantum machine learning, a theoretical void persists. This paper addresses the gap by highlighting the quantum cross entropy, a pivotal counterpart to the classical cross entropy. We establish quantum cross entropy's role in quantum data compression, a fundamental machine learning task, by demonstrating that it acts as the compression rate for sub-optimal quantum source coding. Our approach involves a novel, universal quantum data compression protocol based on the quantum generalization of variable-length coding and the principle of quantum strong typicality. This reveals that quantum cross entropy can effectively serve as a loss function in quantum machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we illustrate that the minimum of quantum cross entropy aligns with the von Neumann entropy, reinforcing its role as the optimal compression rate and underscoring its significance in advancing our understanding of quantum machine learning's theoretical framework.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field that combines the power of quantum computing with the principles of machine learning. One of the significant challenges in QML is dealing with noise in quantum systems, especially in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Noise in quantum systems can introduce errors in quantum computations and degrade the performance of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning observables that are robust against noisy channels in quantum systems. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn observables that remain invariant under the effects of noise and show that this can be achieved through a machine-learning approach. We present a toy example using a Bell state under a depolarization channel to illustrate the concept of robust observables. We then describe a machine-learning framework for learning such observables across six two-qubit quantum circuits and five noisy channels. Our results show that it is possible to learn observables that are more robust to noise than conventional observables. We discuss the implications of this finding for quantum machine learning, including potential applications in enhancing the stability of QML models in noisy environments. By developing techniques for learning robust observables, we can improve the performance and reliability of quantum machine learning models in the presence of noise, contributing to the advancement of practical QML applications in the NISQ era.",

In this work, we propose a feature selection method with a specific focus on quantum machine learning. Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way towards applications of quantum machine learning to practical tasks.

With the prevalence and importance of classical data, a hybrid quantum-classical approach to QML is called for.

In this paper we discuss some important aspects of PQCs with quantum kernels including PQCs, quantum kernels, quantum kernels with quantum advantage, and the trainability of quantum kernels. We conclude that quantum kernels with hybrid kernel methods, a.k.a. quantum kernel methods, offer distinct advantages as a hybrid approach to QML. Not only do they apply to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but they also can be used to solve all types of machine learning problems including regression, classification, clustering, and dimension reduction. Furthermore, beyond quantum utility, quantum advantage can be attained if the quantum kernels, i.e., the quantum feature encodings, are classically intractable.",

This area of research falls under the umbrella of quantum machine learning, a research area of computer science which has recently received wide attention. In particular, we investigate to what extent quantum computers can be used to accelerate supervised machine learning algorithms. The aim of this is to develop a clear understanding of the promises and limitations of the current state of the art of quantum algorithms for supervised machine learning, but also to define directions for future research in this exciting field. We start by looking at supervised quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms through the lens of statistical learning theory. In this framework, we derive novel bounds on the computational complexities of a large set of supervised QML algorithms under the requirement of optimal learning rates. Next, we give a new bound for Hamiltonian simulation of dense Hamiltonians, a major subroutine of most known supervised QML algorithms, and then derive a classical algorithm with nearly the same complexity. We then draw the parallels to recent \"quantum-inspired\" results, and will explain the implications of these results for quantum machine learning applications. Looking for areas which might bear larger advantages for QML algorithms, we finally propose a novel algorithm for Quantum Boltzmann machines, and argue that quantum algorithms for quantum data are one of the most promising applications for QML with potentially exponential advantage over classical approaches.",

This feature map provides opportunities to incorporate quantum advantages into machine learning algorithms to be performed on near-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. The crucial idea is using the quantum Hilbert space as a quantum-enhanced feature space in machine learning models. While the quantum feature map has demonstrated its capability when combined with linear classification models in some specific applications, its expressive power from the theoretical perspective remains unknown. We prove that the machine learning models induced from the quantum-enhanced feature space are universal approximators of continuous functions under typical quantum feature maps. We also study the capability of quantum feature maps in the classification of disjoint regions. Our work enables an important theoretical analysis to ensure that machine learning algorithms based on quantum feature maps can handle a broad class of machine learning tasks. In light of this, one can design a quantum machine learning model with more powerful expressivity.",

    "abstract": "In a conventional circuit for quantum machine learning, the quantum gates used to encode the input parameters and the variational parameters are constructed with a fixed order. The resulting output function, which can be expressed in the form of a restricted Fourier series, has limited flexibility in the distributions of its Fourier coefficients. This indicates that a fixed order of quantum gates can limit the performance of quantum machine learning. Building on this key insight (also elaborated with examples), we introduce indefinite causal order to quantum machine learning. Because the indefinite causal order of quantum gates allows for the superposition of different orders, the performance of quantum machine learning can be significantly enhanced. Considering that the current accessible quantum platforms only allow to simulate a learning structure with a fixed order of quantum gates, we reform the existing simulation protocol to implement indefinite causal order and further demonstrate the positive impact of indefinite causal order on specific learning tasks. Our results offer useful insights into possible quantum effects in quantum machine learning.",

In the quantum case, when the quantum cross entropy is constructed from quantum data undisturbed by quantum measurements, this relation holds. Classical cross entropy is equal to negative log-likelihood. When we obtain quantum cross entropy through empirical density matrix based on measurement outcomes, the quantum cross entropy is lower-bounded by negative log-likelihood.

In machine learning, for a given model architecture, the speed of training the model is typically determined by the size of the training dataset. Thus, quantum machine learning methods have the potential to facilitate learning using extremely large datasets. While the availability of data for training machine learning models is steadily increasing, oftentimes it is much easier to collect feature vectors that to obtain the corresponding labels. One of the approaches for addressing this issue is to use semi-supervised learning, which leverages not only the labeled samples, but also unlabeled feature vectors. Here, we present a quantum machine learning algorithm for training Semi-Supervised Kernel Support Vector Machines. The algorithm uses recent advances in quantum sample-based Hamiltonian simulation to extend the existing Quantum LS-SVM algorithm to handle the semi-supervised term in the loss. Through a theoretical study of the algorithm's computational complexity, we show that it maintains the same speedup as the fully-supervised Quantum LS-SVM.",

    "abstract": "In the Quantum Supremacy regime, quantum computers may overcome classical machines on several tasks if we can estimate, mitigate, or correct unavoidable hardware noise. Estimating the error requires classical simulations, which become unfeasible in the Quantum Supremacy regime. We leverage Machine Learning data-driven approaches and Conformal Prediction, a Machine Learning uncertainty quantification tool known for its mild assumptions and finite-sample validity, to find theoretically valid upper bounds of the fidelity between noiseless and noisy outputs of quantum devices. Under reasonable extrapolation assumptions, the proposed scheme applies to any Quantum Computing hardware, does not require modeling the device's noise sources, and can be used when classical simulations are unavailable, e.g. in the Quantum Supremacy regime.",

The rate of energy dissipation decreases as the learning error rate decreases linking thermodynamic efficiency and learning efficiency. In the classical case the energy is dissipated as heat. We give an example based on a quantum optical perceptron where the energy is dissipated as spontaneous emission. At optical frequencies the temperature is effectively zero so this perceptron is as efficient as it is possible to get. The example illustrates a general point: In a classical learning machine, measurement is taken to reveal objective facts about the world.

However, quantum noise is a major obstacle to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. In this work, we define a formal framework for the robustness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning algorithms against noises. A robust bound is derived and an algorithm is developed to check whether or not a quantum machine learning algorithm is robust with respect to quantum training data. In particular, this algorithm can find adversarial examples during checking. Our approach is implemented on Google's TensorFlow Quantum and can verify the robustness of quantum machine learning algorithms with respect to a small disturbance of noises, derived from the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of our robust bound and algorithm is confirmed by the experimental results, including quantum bits classification as the \"Hello World\" example, quantum phase recognition and cluster excitation detection from real world intractable physical problems, and the classification of MNIST from the classical world.",

In this context, we explore the capability of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to improve model generalization and increase accuracy while reducing computational resources. We also illustrate how machine learning can be used both to mitigate the effects of errors on presently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and to understand quantum advantage via an automatic study of quantum walk processes on graphs.

    "abstract": "Although quantum machine learning has been introduced for a while, its applications in computer vision are still limited. This paper, therefore, revisits the quantum visual encoding strategies, the initial step in quantum machine learning. Investigating the root cause, we uncover that the existing quantum encoding design fails to ensure information preservation of the visual features after the encoding process, thus complicating the learning process of the quantum machine learning models. In particular, the problem, termed \"Quantum Information Gap\" (QIG), leads to a gap of information between classical and corresponding quantum features. We provide theoretical proof and practical demonstrations of that found and underscore the significance of QIG, as it directly impacts the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a simple but efficient new loss function named Quantum Information Preserving (QIP) to minimize this gap, resulting in enhanced performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance compared to current methodologies and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in quantum modeling.",

    "abstract": "When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation\" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is often highlighted as one of the most promising practical applications for which quantum computers could provide a computational advantage. However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of quantum machine learning models in practice is that these models, even once trained, still require access to a quantum computer in order to be evaluated on new data. To solve this issue, we introduce a new class of quantum models where quantum resources are only required during training, while the deployment of the trained model is classical. Specifically, the training phase of our models ends with the generation of a 'shadow model' from which the classical deployment becomes possible. We prove that: i) this class of models is universal for classically-deployed quantum machine learning; ii) it does have restricted learning capacities compared to 'fully quantum' models, but nonetheless iii) it achieves a provable learning advantage over fully classical learners, contingent on widely-believed assumptions in complexity theory. These results provide compelling evidence that quantum machine learning can confer learning advantages across a substantially broader range of scenarios, where quantum computers are exclusively employed during the training phase. By enabling classical deployment, our approach facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning models in various practical contexts.",

    "abstract": "The goal of generative machine learning is to model the probability distribution underlying a given data set. This probability distribution helps to characterize the generation process of the data samples. While classical generative machine learning is solely based on classical resources, generative quantum machine learning can also employ quantum resources - such as parameterized quantum channels and quantum operators - to learn and sample from the probability model of interest.   Applications of generative (quantum) models are multifaceted. The trained model can generate new samples that are compatible with the given data and extend the data set. Additionally, learning a model for the generation process of a data set may provide interesting information about the corresponding properties. With the help of quantum resources, the respective generative models have access to functions that are difficult to evaluate with a classical computer and may improve the performance or lead to new insights. Furthermore, generative quantum machine learning can be applied to efficient, approximate loading of classical data into a quantum state which may help to avoid - potentially exponentially - expensive, exact quantum data loading.   The aim of this doctoral thesis is to develop new generative quantum machine learning algorithms, demonstrate their feasibility, and analyze their performance. Additionally, we outline their potential application to efficient, approximate quantum data loading. More specifically, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network and a quantum Boltzmann machine implementation, both of which can be realized with parameterized quantum circuits. These algorithms are compatible with first-generation quantum hardware and, thus, enable us to study proof of concept implementations not only with numerical quantum simulations but also real quantum hardware available today.",

As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation.

    "title": "Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing",
    "abstract": "With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.",

The computational complexity and the time taken both increase rapidly with the number of investments in the portfolio. It becomes difficult, even impossible for classic computers to solve. Quantum computing is a new way of computing which takes advantage of quantum superposition and entanglement. It changes how such problems are approached and is not constrained by some of the classic computational complexity. Studies have shown that quantum computing can offer significant advantages over classical computing in many fields. The application of quantum computing has been constrained by the unavailability of actual quantum computers. In the past decade, there has been the rapid development of the large-scale quantum computer. However, software development for quantum computing is slow in many fields. In our study, we apply quantum computing to a multi-asset portfolio simulation. The simulation is based on historic data, covariance, and expected returns, all calculated using quantum computing. Although technically a solvable problem for classical computing, we believe the software development is important to the future application of quantum computing in finance.

    "abstract": "Computational devices may be supplied with external sources of information (oracles). Quantum oracles may transmit phase information which is available to a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical computer but which allows a quantum computer to solve undecidable problems. Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to computer.",

Our approach hides the generation and distribution of entanglement in quantum networks by taking advantage of relativistic quantum effects. We devise a suite of covert quantum teleportation protocols that utilize the shared entanglement, local operations, and covert classical communication to transfer or process quantum information in stealth. As an application of our covert suite, we construct two prominent examples of measurement-based quantum computation, namely the teleportation-based quantum computer and the one-way quantum computer. In the latter case we explore the covert generation of graph states, and subsequently outline a protocol for the covert implementation of universal blind quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Photonic quantum computation refers to quantum computation that uses photons as the physical system for doing the quantum computation. Photons are ideal quantum systems because they operate at room temperature, and photonic technologies are relatively mature. The field is largely divided between discrete- and continuous-variable photonic quantum computation. In discrete-variable (DV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarization) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties and eventually measured using single photon detectors. In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagnetic field is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and then detected via homodyne detection. Both CV and DV photonic quantum computation have been realized experimentally and they each have a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable photonic universal quantum computation. This article is an introduction to photonic quantum computing, charting its development from the early days of linear optical quantum computing to recent developments in quantum machine learning.",

    "abstract": "The DiVincenzo criteria for implementing a quantum computer have been seminal in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing (paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and (4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular physical implementation.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of quantum computing technology has led to the emergence of early-stage quantum cloud computing services. To fully realize the potential of quantum cloud computing, it is essential to develop techniques that ensure the privacy of both data and functions. Quantum computations often leverage superposition to evaluate a function on all possible inputs simultaneously, making function privacy a critical requirement. In 2009, Broadbent et al. introduced the Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) protocol, which is based on Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) and provides a framework for ensuring both function and data privacy in quantum computing. Although theoretical results indicate an equivalence between MBQC and circuitbased quantum computation, translating MBQC into circuitbased implementations remains challenging due to higher qubit requirements and the complexity of the transformation process. Consequently, current quantum cloud computing platforms are limited in their ability to simulate MBQC efficiently. This paper presents an efficient method to simulate MBQC on circuit-based quantum computing platforms. We validate this approach by implementing the two-qubit Grover algorithm in the MBQC framework and further demonstrate blindness by applying the UBQC protocol. This work verifies the simulation of a blind quantum computation using the two-qubit Grover algorithm on a circuit-based quantum computing platform.",

    "abstract": "The standard generic quantum computer model is studied analytically and numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability. The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined. In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules, finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in the paper.",

As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including aspects of quantum walk theories and characteristics, advances in their physical implementations and the flourishingly developed quantum walk computing applications.

    "abstract": "With the advantages of high-speed parallel processing, quantum computers can efficiently solve large-scale complex optimization problems in future networks. However, due to the uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise, distributed quantum computing which relies on quantum networks connected through entanglement faces a lot of challenges for exchanging information across quantum computers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive distributed quantum computing approach to manage quantum computers and quantum channels for solving optimization tasks in future networks. Firstly, we describe the fundamentals of quantum computing and its distributed concept in quantum networks. Secondly, to address the uncertainty of future demands of collaborative optimization tasks and instability over quantum networks, we propose a quantum resource allocation scheme based on stochastic programming for minimizing quantum resource consumption. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we discuss the potential applications for collaborative optimization in future networks, such as smart grid management, IoT cooperation, and UAV trajectory planning. Promising research directions that can lead to the design and implementation of future distributed quantum computing frameworks are also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.",

The paper explores the motivations and challenges of employing quantum cryptography, addressing security and privacy concerns along with existing solutions. Secure key distribution, a critical component in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information over a network, is emphasized in the discussion. The survey examines the potential of quantum cryptography to enable secure key exchange between parties, even when faced with eavesdropping, and other applications of quantum cryptography. Additionally, the paper analyzes the methodologies, findings, and limitations of each reviewed study, pinpointing trends such as the increasing focus on practical implementation of quantum cryptography protocols and the growing interest in postquantum cryptography research.

Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols.   For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We show that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.",

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) starts standardizing quantum-resistant public-key cryptography (aka post-quantum cryptography). The reason is that investment in quantum computing is blooming which poses significant threats to our currently deployed cryptographic algorithms. As a security engineer, to prepare for the apocalypse in advance, I've been watching the development of quantum computers and post-quantum cryptography closely. Never mind, I simply made up an excuse to study these fascinating scientific fields. However, they are extremely hard to understand, at least to an amateur like me.

    "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing poses a profound threat to traditional cryptographic systems, exposing vulnerabilities that compromise the security of digital communication channels reliant on RSA, ECC, and similar classical encryption methods. Quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm, exploit the inherent computational power of quantum computers to efficiently solve mathematical problems underlying these cryptographic schemes. In response, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) emerged as a critical field aimed at developing resilient cryptographic algorithms impervious to quantum attacks. This paper delineates the vulnerabilities of classical cryptographic systems to quantum attacks, elucidates the principles of quantum computing, and introduces various PQC algorithms such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, and multivariate polynomial cryptography. Highlighting the importance of PQC in securing digital communication amidst quantum computing advancements, this research underscores its pivotal role in safeguarding data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in the face of emerging quantum threats.",

They are going to be vulnerable with fault-tolerant quantum computers. We also know that the uncertainty principle for quantum bits or qubits such as quantum key distribution or QKD based on the quantum uncertainty principle offers the information theoretical security. The interesting implication with the paradigm shifts from classical computing to quantum computing is that the NP-hardness used for classical cryptography may shift to the uncertainty principles for quantum cryptography including quantum symmetric encryption, post-quantum cryptography, as well as quantum encryption in phase space for coherent optical communications. This paper would like to explore those so-called generalized uncertainty principles and explain what their implications are for quantum security. We identified three generalized uncertainty principles offering quantum security: non-commutability between permutation gates, non-commutability between the displacement and phase shift operators for coherent states, and the modular Diophantine Equation Problem in general linear algebra for post-quantum cryptography.",

In recent years, although some homomorphic encryption algorithms have been proposed based on prime factorization problems, the algorithms may be cracked by quantum computing attacks. Therefore, this study proposes a post-quantum cryptography (PQC)-based homomorphic encryption method which includes the homomorphic encryption function based on a code-based cryptography method for avoiding quantum computing attacks. Subsection 3.2 proposes mathematical models to prove the feasibility of the proposed method, and Subsection 3.3 gives calculation examples to present the detailed steps of the proposed method. In experimental environments, the mainstream cryptography methods (i.e. RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)) have been compared, and the results show that the encryption time and decryption time of the proposed method are shorter than other cryptography methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is designed based on a non-negative matrix factorization problem (i.e. a NP problem) for resisting quantum computing attacks.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the elliptic curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificate scheme has found application in security credential management systems (SCMS) and secure vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to issue pseudonymous certificates. However, the vulnerability of elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) to polynomial-time attacks posed by quantum computing raises concerns. In order to enhance resistance against quantum computing threats, various post-quantum cryptography methods have been adopted as standard (e.g. Dilithium) or candidate standard methods (e.g. McEliece cryptography), but state of the art has proven to be challenging to implement implicit certificates using lattice-based cryptography methods. Therefore, this study proposes a post-quantum cryptography McEliece-Chen (PQCMC) based on an efficient random invertible matrix generation method to issue pseudonymous certificates with less computation time. The study provides mathematical models to validate the key expansion process for implicit certificates. Furthermore, comprehensive security evaluations and discussions are conducted to demonstrate that distinct implicit certificates can be linked to the same end entity. In experiments, a comparison is conducted between the certificate length and computation time to evaluate the performance of the proposed PQCMC. This study demonstrates the viability of the implicit certificate scheme based on PQC as a means of countering quantum computing threats.",

    "title": "Assumptions in Quantum Cryptography",
    "abstract": "Quantum cryptography uses techniques and ideas from physics and computer science. The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum cryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol is secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these assumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may break the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent on which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an implementation of the protocol.   This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection between the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their experimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key distribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties. We provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics using the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key distribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline several mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or simplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in quantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in implementations.   Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes quantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes. Protocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which kinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions are justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an eavesdropper. Two contributions of the author are discussed: the security proofs of two two-way quantum-key-distribution protocols and an intuitive proof of the data-processing inequality.",

    "abstract": "In the distrustful quantum cryptography model the different parties have conflicting interests and do not trust one another. Nevertheless, they trust the quantum devices in their labs. The aim of the device-independent approach to cryptography is to do away with the necessity of making this assumption, and, consequently, significantly increase security. In this paper we enquire whether the scope of the device-independent approach can be extended to the distrustful cryptography model, thereby rendering it `fully' distrustful. We answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a device-independent (imperfect) bit-commitment protocol, which we then use to construct a device-independent coin flipping protocol.",

That could lead to unnoticed complete compromise of cryptographic systems, without a chance of control by its legitimate owners. Therefore a need for innovative solutions exists when truly and reliably secure transmission of secrets is required for dealing with critical data and applications. Quantum Cryptography (QC), in particular Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can answer that need.   The business white paper (BWP) summarizes how secret key establishment and distribution problems can be solved by quantum cryptography. It deals with several considerations related to how the quantum cryptography innovation could contribute to provide business effectiveness. It addresses advantages and also limitations of quantum cryptography, proposes a scenario case study, and invokes standardization related issues. In addition, it answers most frequently asked questions about quantum cryptography.",

Its the technology that will reduce the computing time from years to hours or even minutes. The power of quantum computing will be a great support for the scientific community. However, it raises serious threats to cybersecurity. Theoretically, all the cryptography algorithms are vulnerable to attack. The practical quantum computers, when available with millions of qubits capacity, will be able to break nearly all modern public-key cryptographic systems. Before the quantum computers arrive with sufficient qubit capacity, we must be ready with quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, tools, techniques, and deployment strategies to protect the ICT infrastructure. This paper discusses in detail the global effort for the design, development, and standardization of various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms along with the performance analysis of some of the potential quantum-safe algorithms. Most of the quantum-safe algorithms need more CPU cycles, higher runtime memory, and large key size. The objective of the paper is to analyze the feasibility of the various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms.",

We consider a more powerful adversary who can demand private information of users. This type of adversary has been studied in public key cryptography in recent years, initiated by Persiano, Phan, and Yung at Eurocrypt 2022. We introduce a similar attacker to quantum communication, referring to it as the controller. The controller is a quantum computer that controls the entire communication infrastructure, including both classical and quantum channels. It can even ban classical public key cryptography and post-quantum public key cryptography, leaving only quantum cryptography and post-quantum symmetric key cryptography as the remaining options. We demonstrate how such a controller can control quantum communication and how users can achieve covert communication under its control.",

The other is quantum Isomap algorithm based on quantum Floyd algorithm, which finds a low-dimensional representation for the original high-dimensional data.

    "abstract": "Many quantum algorithms for attacking symmetric cryptography involve the rank problem of quantum linear equations. In this paper, we first propose two quantum algorithms for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition and construct their specific quantum circuits. Unlike previous related works, our quantum algorithms are universal. Specifically, the two quantum algorithms can both compute the rank and general solution by one measurement. The difference between them is whether the data register containing the quantum coefficient matrix can be disentangled with other registers and keep the data qubits unchanged. On this basis, we apply the two quantum algorithms as a subroutine to parallel Simon's algorithm (with multiple periods), Grover Meets Simon algorithm, and Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm, respectively. Afterwards, we construct a quantum classifier within Grover Meets Simon algorithm and the test oracle within Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm in detail, including their respective quantum circuits. To our knowledge, no such specific analysis has been done before. We rigorously analyze the success probability of those algorithms to ensure that the success probability based on the proposed quantum algorithms will not be lower than that of those original algorithms. Finally, we discuss the lower bound of the number of CNOT gates for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition, and our quantum algorithms reach the optimum in terms of minimizing the number of CNOT gates. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the proposed algorithms are mainly suitable for conducting attacks against lightweight symmetric ciphers, within the effective working time of an ion trap quantum computer.",

Most quantum algorithms assume that the time-evolution is perfectly unitary and that the full Hilbert space is available. However, in practice, the available entanglement may be limited, leading to a reduced fidelity of the quantum algorithms. To simulate the execution of quantum algorithms with limited entanglement, tensor-network methods provide a useful framework, since they allow us to restrict the entanglement in a quantum circuit. Thus, we here use tensor-networks to analyze the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm as the entanglement is reduced, and we map out the entanglement that is generated during the execution of each algorithm. In all three cases, we find that the algorithms can be executed with high fidelity even if the entanglement is somewhat reduced. Our results are promising for the execution of these algorithms on future quantum computers, and our simulation method based on tensor networks may also be applied to other quantum algorithms.",

In the end, we apply UPEA to quantum counting, and use an additional correction step to make the quantum counting algorithm unbiased.",

At present, people are committed to building powerful quantum algorithms and tapping the potential of quantum algorithms, so as to further analyze the security of cryptographic algorithms under quantum computing. Recombining classical quantum algorithms is one of the current ideas to construct quantum algorithms. However, they cannot be easily combined, the feasibility of quantum algorithms needs further analysis in quantum environment. This paper reanalyzes the existing combined algorithm Grover-meets-Simon algorithm in terms of the principle of deferred measurement. First of all, due to the collapse problem caused by the measurement, we negate the measurement process of Simon's algorithm during the process of the Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Second, since the output of the unmeasured Simon algorithm is quantum linear systems of equations, we discuss the solution of quantum linear systems of equations and find it feasible to consider the deferred measurement of the parallel Simon algorithm alone. Finally, since the Grover-meets-Simon algorithm involves an iterative problem, we reconsider the feasibility of the algorithm when placing multiple measurements at the end. According to the maximum probability of success and query times, we get that the Grover-meets-Simon algorithm is not an effective attack algorithm when putting the measurement process of the Simon algorithm in the iterative process at the end of Grover-meets-Simon algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers is challenging when the system size, i.e., the number of qubits used in the quantum algorithm, is moderately large. However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding quantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the input quantum state is a low-rank tensor and all intermediate states of the quantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low-rank tensors. In this paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms by using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input and all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms are used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms preserve the low-rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states in other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation more difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or superiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer. As a result, understanding the low-rank structure of a quantum algorithm allows us to identify algorithms that can benefit significantly from quantum computers.",

For any Boolean function there exists a span program that leads to a quantum algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity. In general, finding such span programs is not an easy task. In this work, given a query access to the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we provide two new span-program-based quantum algorithms: an algorithm for testing if the graph is bipartite that uses $O(n\\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries; an algorithm for testing if the graph is connected that uses $O(n\\sqrt{n})$ quantum queries.",

We consider two examples that are relevant to post-quantum cryptography: Grover's search algorithm, and the quantum algorithm for collision-finding. Using Bennett's \"Brownian\" model of low-power reversible computation, we show classical algorithms that have the same asymptotic energy consumption as these quantum algorithms. Thus, the quantum advantage in query complexity does not imply a reduction in these thermodynamic resource costs. In addition, we present realistic estimates of the resource costs of quantum and classical search, for near-future computing technologies. We find that, if memory is cheap, classical exhaustive search can be surprisingly competitive with Grover's algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers have been heavily investigated on quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithms to find the unknown phase, since QPE is the core building block of the most quantum algorithms such as the Shor's factoring algorithm, quantum sampling algorithms, and finding the eigenvalues of unitary matrices. Kitaev's algorithm and QPE algorithms using inverse Quantum Fourier transform were proposed and widely used by researchers as a key component for their quantum algorithms. In this paper, we explore the experimental challenges of QPE algorithms on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers by implementing various QPE algorithms on the state-of-the-art IBM quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of finding the phase using these algorithms are severely constrained by NISQ's physical characteristics such as coherence time and error rates. To mitigate such physical limitations, we propose modified solutions of these algorithms by reducing the number of control gates and phase shift operations. Our experimental results showed that our solutions can significantly increase the accuracy of the finding phase in near-term quantum computers.",

Regardless of which hardware platform these novel algorithms operate on, whether it is adiabatic or gate based, from theoretical point of view, they are performing drastically better than their classical counterparts. Two promising areas of quantum algorithms quantum machine learning and quantum optimization. These are based on performing matrix operations using quantum states and operation, in order to speed up data analysis where quantum computing can efficiently work with high dimensional vectors. Motivated by that, quantum inspired algorithms (e.g. for recommendation systems and principal component analysis) are developed to cope with high dimensionality using probabilistic techniques that are inspire from quantum computing. In this paper we review recent progress in the area of quantum inspired algorithms for low rank matrix approximation. We further explore the possibility of using parametrized complexity for such algorithms to refine practical complexity analysis. Finally, we conjecture that quantum inspired algorithms that use low rank approximation and also sample and query technique for input representations are Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT).",

[Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information science is an exciting, wide, rapidly progressing, cross-disciplinary field, and that very nature makes it both attractive and hard to enter. In this primer, we first provide answers to the three essential questions that any newcomer needs to know: How is quantum information represented? How is quantum information processed? How is classical information extracted from quantum states? We then introduce the most basic quantum information theoretic notions concerning entropy, sources, and channels, as well as secure communications and error correction. We conclude with examples that illustrate the power of quantum correlations. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is assumed.",

The entanglement between states of measured system and \"pointer\" states of measuring apparatus, which is generated by dynamical process of quantum measurement, plays a dominant role in expressing quantum characteristics of information theory. The quantum mutual information of transmission and reception of quantum states along a noisy quantum channel is given by the change of quantum measured information. In our approach, it is not necessary to purify the transmitted state by means of the reference system. It is also clarified that there exist relations between the approach given in this letter and those given by other authors.",

In particular, I demonstrate several novel limits to the information processing ability of quantum mechanics. Results of especial interest include: the demonstration of limitations to the class of measurements which may be performed in quantum mechanics; a capacity theorem giving achievable limits to the transmission of classical information through a two-way noiseless quantum channel; resource bounds on distributed quantum computation; a new proof of the quantum noiseless channel coding theorem; an information-theoretic characterization of the conditions under which quantum error-correction may be achieved; an analysis of the thermodynamic limits to quantum error-correction, and new bounds on channel capacity for noisy quantum channels.",

The space of quantum gravity provides both the non-fixed causality of general relativity and the quantum uncertainty of quantum mechanics. In a quantum gravity scenario, the causal structure is indefinite and the processes are causally non-separable. Here, we provide a model for the information processing structure of quantum gravity. We show that the quantum gravity environment is an information resource-pool from which valuable information can be extracted. We analyze the structure of the quantum gravity space and the entanglement of the space-time geometry. We study the information transfer capabilities of quantum gravity space and define the quantum gravity channel. We reveal that the quantum gravity space acts as a background noise on the local environment states. We characterize the properties of the noise of the quantum gravity space and show that it allows the separate local parties to simulate remote outputs from the local environment state, through the process of remote simulation.",

However, this information could be corrupted as the systems are prone to quantum noises, and its distortion under quantum dynamics has not been adequately investigated. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to study how well we can retrieve information from noisy quantum states. Given a noisy quantum channel, we fully characterize the range of recoverable classical information. This condition allows a natural measure quantifying the information recoverability of a channel. Moreover, we resolve the minimum information retrieving cost, which, along with the corresponding optimal protocol, is efficiently computable by semidefinite programming. As applications, we establish the limits on the information retrieving cost for practical quantum noises and employ the corresponding protocols to mitigate errors in ground state energy estimation. Our work gives the first full characterization of information recoverability of noisy quantum states from the recoverable range to the recovering cost, revealing the ultimate limit of probabilistic error cancellation.",

Despite classical information being a subset of quantum information, the rate of the quantum capacity problem is expressed in terms of the coherent information, which does not mathematically generalize the classical mutual information. Additionally, there are multiple capacity theorems with distinct formulas when dealing with transmitting information over a noisy quantum channel. This leads to the question of what constitutes a mathematically accurate quantum generalization of classical mutual information and whether there exists a quantum task that directly extends the classical capacity problem. In this paper, we address these inquiries by introducing a quantity called the generalized information, which serves as a mathematical extension encompassing both classical mutual information and coherent information. We define a transmission task, which includes as specific instances both classical information and quantum information capacity problems, and show that the transmission capacity of this task is characterized by the generalized information.",

In this work, by a proper refinement of the physical settings of quantum communication, we prove additive quantities for quantum channel capacities that can be employed for quantum Shannon theorems.

    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics provides a disembodied way to transfer quantum information from one quantum object to another. In theory, this quantum information transfer can occur between quantum objects of any dimension, yet the reported experiments of quantum information transfer to date have mainly focused on the cases where the quantum objects have the same dimension. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for quantum information transfer between quantum objects of different dimensions.By using an optical qubit-ququart entangling gate, we observe the transfer of quantum information between two photons with different dimensions, including the flow of quantum information from a four-dimensional photon to a two-dimensional photon and vice versa.The fidelities of the quantum information transfer range from 0.700 to 0.917, all above the classical limit of 2/3. Our work sheds light on a new direction for quantum information transfer and demonstrates our ability to implement entangling operations beyond two-level quantum systems.",

This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.",

Here we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong converse rate for quantum communication: For any sequence of codes with rate exceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing on the transmitted quantum data. As an application of this result, for generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum communication over such channels. Thus we conclusively settle the strong converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial quantum capacity.",

However, this definition of metamaterials can be extended if we introduce a quantum degree of freedom by adding some quantum elements (e.g quantum dots, cold atoms, Josephson junctions, molecules). Quantum metamaterials can then be defined as artificially engineered nanostructures made up of quantum elements. Furthermore, they exhibit controllable quantum states, maintain quantum coherence for times much higher than the transversal time of the electromagnetic signal. Metamaterials have been used to realised invisibility cloaking, super-resolution, energy harvesting, and sensing. Most of these applications are performed in the classical regime. Of recent, metamaterials have gradually found their way into the quantum regime, particularly to quantum sensing and quantum information processing. The use of quantum metamaterials for quantum information processing is still new and rapidly growing. In quantum information processing, quantum metamaterials have enabled the control and manipulation of quantum states, single photon generation, creating quantum entanglement, quantum states switching, quantum search algorithm, quantum state engineering tasks, and many more. In this work, we briefly review the theory, fabrication and applications of quantum metamaterials to quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Information theory establishes the fundamental limits on data transmission, storage, and processing. Quantum information theory unites information theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates. Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and intriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive functions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum information theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a deeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical multi-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum channel capacities.",

These quantities both require minimal assumptions on the eavesdropper, i.e., they do not make any assumptions on the eavesdropper's attack strategy or the statistical prior on the secret or private classical data encoded in the quantum system. They also satisfy important properties of positivity, independence, post-processing inequality, and unitary invariance. The barycentric quantum Renyi leakage can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and the pairwise quantum Renyi leakage possesses an explicit formula. The barycentric and pairwise quantum Renyi leakages form upper bounds on the maximal quantum leakage, the sandwiched quantum $\\alpha$-mutual information, the accessible information, and the Holevo's information. Furthermore, differentially-private quantum channels are shown to bound these measures of information leakage. Global and local depolarizing channels, that are common models of noise in quantum computing and communication, restrict private or secure information leakage. Finally, a privacy-utility trade-off formula in quantum machine learning using variational circuits is developed. The privacy guarantees can only be strengthened, i.e., information leakage can only be reduced, if the performance degradation grows larger and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "In usual quantum theory, the information available about a quantum system is defined in terms of the density matrix describing it on a spacelike surface. This definition must be generalized for extensions of quantum theory which do not have a notion of state on a spacelike surface. It must be generalized for the generalized quantum theories appropriate when spacetime geometry fluctuates quantum mechanically or when geometry is fixed but not foliable by spacelike surfaces. This paper introduces a four-dimensional notion of the information available about a quantum system's boundary conditions in the various sets of decohering histories it may display. The idea of spacetime information is applied in several contexts: When spacetime geometry is fixed the information available through alternatives restricted to a spacetime region is defined. The information available through histories of alternatives of general operators is compared to that obtained from the more limited coarse- grainings of sum-over-histories quantum mechanics. The definition of information is considered in generalized quantum theories. We consider as specific examples time-neutral quantum mechanics with initial and final conditions, quantum theories with non-unitary evolution, and the generalized quantum frameworks appropriate for quantum spacetime. In such theories complete information about a quantum system is not necessarily available on any spacelike surface but must be searched for throughout spacetime. The information loss commonly associated with the ``evolution of pure states into mixed states'' in black hole evaporation is thus not in conflict with the principles of generalized quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "We develop a theoretical framework for frame synchronization, also known as block synchronization, in the quantum domain which makes it possible to attach classical and quantum metadata to quantum information over a noisy channel even when the information source and sink are frame-wise asynchronous. This eliminates the need of frame synchronization at the hardware level and allows for parsing qubit sequences during quantum information processing. Our framework exploits binary constant-weight codes that are self-synchronizing. Possible applications may include asynchronous quantum communication such as a self-synchronizing quantum network where one can hop into the channel at any time, catch the next coming quantum information with a label indicating the sender, and reply by routing her quantum information with control qubits for quantum switches all without assuming prior frame synchronization between users.",

Such a limitation is not present in the theory of classical information, where the mutual information between two random variables is well-defined irrespective of whether or not the variables are separated in space or separated in time. Motivated by this disparity between the classical and quantum mutual information, we employ the pseudo-density matrix formalism to define a simple extension of quantum mutual information into the time domain. As in the spatial case, we show that such a notion of quantum mutual information in time serves as a natural measure of correlation between timelike-separated systems, while also highlighting ways in which quantum correlations distinguish between space and time. We also show how such quantum mutual information is time-symmetric with respect to quantum Bayesian inversion, and then we conclude by showing how mutual information in time yields a Holevo bound for the amount of classical information that may be extracted from sequential measurements on an ensemble of quantum states.",

The protocol can be directly applied to the most advanced quantum error correction techniques, e.g. surface code.

Recently it was realized that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes. These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are generalizations of Shor's original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the number of stabilizer measurements needed in their error recovery routines.",

Quantum error correction encodes the quantum information into a logical state with a high-degree of symmetry. Perturbations are first detected by measuring the symmetries of the quantum state and then corrected by applying a set of gates based on the measurements. In order to measure the symmetries without perturbing the data, ancillary quantum states are required. Shor error correction uses a separate quantum state for the measurement of each symmetry. Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously. Here we experimentally compare Shor and Steane correction of bit flip errors using the Bacon-Shor code implemented in a chain of 23 trapped atomic ions. We find that the Steane error correction provides better logical error rates after a single-round of error correction and less disturbance to the data qubits without error correction.",

We determine the optimum number of verification steps to be used in Shor state construction and whether Shor states without verification are usable for practical quantum computation. These results are compared to the same processes of encoding and error correction where Shor states are not used. We demonstrate that the construction of logical zero states with no first order error terms may not require the complete edifice of quantum fault tolerance. With respect to error correction, we show for a particular initial state that error correction using a single qubit for syndrome measurement yields a similar output state accuracy to error correction using Shor states as syndrome qubits. In addition, we demonstrate that error correction with Shor states has an inherent sensitivity to bit-flip errors. Finally, we suggest that in this type of error correction scenario one should always repeat a syndrome measurement until attaining an all zero readout (twice in row).",

    "abstract": "To implement fault-tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables, the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit has been recognized as an important technological element. We have proposed a method to reduce the required squeezing level to realize large scale quantum computation with the GKP qubit [Phys. Rev. X. {\\bf 8}, 021054 (2018)], harnessing the virtue of analog information in the GKP qubits. In the present work, to reduce the number of qubits required for large scale quantum computation, we propose the tracking quantum error correction, where the logical-qubit level quantum error correction is partially substituted by the single-qubit level quantum error correction. In the proposed method, the analog quantum error correction is utilized to make the performances of the single-qubit level quantum error correction almost identical to those of the logical-qubit level quantum error correction in a practical noise level. The numerical results show that the proposed tracking quantum error correction reduces the number of qubits during a quantum error correction process by the reduction rate $\\left\\{{2(n-1)\\times4^{l-1}-n+1}\\right\\}/({2n \\times 4^{l-1}})$ for $n$-cycles of the quantum error correction process using the Knill's $C_{4}/C_{6}$ code with the concatenation level $l$. Hence, the proposed tracking quantum error correction has great advantage in reducing the required number of physical qubits, and will open a new way to bring up advantage of the GKP qubits in practical quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "In quantum error correction using imperfect primitives, errors of high weight arising from a few faults are major concerns since they might not be correctable by the quantum error correcting code. Fortunately, some errors of different weights are logically equivalent and the same correction procedure is applicable to all equivalent errors, thus correcting high-weight errors is sometimes possible. In this work, we introduce a technique called weight parity error correction (WPEC) which can correct Pauli error of any weight in some stabilizer codes provided that the parity of the weight of the error is known. We show that the technique is applicable to concatenated codes constructed from the [[7,1,3]] Steane code or the [[23,1,7]] Golay code. We also provide a fault-tolerant error correction protocol using WPEC for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code which can correct up to 3 faults and requires only 2 ancillas.",

In this paper we study quantum error correction for a restricted class of time-correlated errors in a spin-boson model. The algorithm we propose allows the correction of two errors per error correction cycle, provided that one of them is time-correlated.

    "abstract": "One of the main problems in quantum information systems is the presence of errors due to noise, and for this reason quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) play a key role. While most of the known codes are designed for correcting generic errors, i.e., errors represented by arbitrary combinations of Pauli X , Y and Z operators, in this paper we investigate the design of stabilizer QECC able to correct a given number eg of generic Pauli errors, plus eZ Pauli errors of a specified type, e.g., Z errors. These codes can be of interest when the quantum channel is asymmetric in that some types of error occur more frequently than others. We first derive a generalized quantum Hamming bound for such codes, then propose a design methodology based on syndrome assignments. For example, we found a [[9,1]] quantum error-correcting code able to correct up to one generic qubit error plus one Z error in arbitrary positions. This, according to the generalized quantum Hamming bound, is the shortest code with the specified error correction capability. Finally, we evaluate analytically the performance of the new codes over asymmetric channels.",

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation with depolarization error often requires demanding error threshold and resource overhead. If the operations can maintain high noise bias -- dominated by dephasing error with small bit-flip error -- we can achieve hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation with a more favorable error threshold. Distinct from two-level physical systems, multi-level systems (such as harmonic oscillators) can achieve a desirable set of bias-preserving quantum operations while using continuous engineered dissipation or Hamiltonian protection to stabilize to the encoding subspace. For example, cat codes stabilized with driven-dissipation or Kerr nonlinearity can possess a set of biased-preserving gates while continuously correcting bosonic dephasing error. However, cat codes are not compatible with continuous quantum error correction against excitation loss error, because it is challenging to continuously monitor the parity to correct photon loss errors. In this work, we generalize the bias-preserving operations to pair-cat codes, which can be regarded as a multimode generalization of cat codes, to be compatible with continuous quantum error correction against both bosonic loss and dephasing errors. Our results open the door towards hardware-efficient robust quantum information processing with both bias-preserving operations and continuous quantum error correction simultaneously correcting bosonic loss and dephasing errors.",

Here we demonstrate that quantum error correction can be applied significantly less often with only a minimal loss of fidelity. This is done by simulating the implementation of 50 encoded, single-qubit, quantum gates within the [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code in a noisy, non-equiprobable Pauli error environment with error correction being applied at different intervals. We find that applying error correction after every gate is rarely optimal and even applying error correction only once after all 50 gates, though not generally optimal, sacrifices only a slight amount of fidelity with the benefit of 50-fold saving of resources. In addition, we find that in cases where bit-flip errors are dominant, it is best not to apply error correction at all.",

    "abstract": "Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is known to possess some intrinsic robustness, though it is likely that some form of error correction will be necessary for large scale computations. Error handling routines developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily to the AQC model since these routines typically require high-quality quantum gates, a resource not generally allowed in AQC. There are two main techniques known to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy gap protection and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that both these methods are intimately related and can be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form of error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing error correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems.   This work is a companion paper to \"Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics\"', which provides a dynamical model perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and error correction in AQC. In this paper we discuss the same results within a quantum information framework, permitting an intuitive discussion of error suppression and correction in encoded AQC.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that continuous-variable quantum error correction based on Gaussian ancilla states and Gaussian operations (for encoding, syndrome extraction, and recovery) can be very useful to suppress the effect of non-Gaussian error channels. For a certain class of stochastic error models, reminiscent of those typically considered in the qubit case, quantum error correction codes designed for single-channel errors may enhance the transfer fidelities even when errors occur in every channel employed for transmitting the encoded state. In fact, in this case, the error-correcting capability of the continuous-variable scheme turns out to be higher than that of its discrete-variable analogues.",

For reliable operation of multi-valued quantum systems, error correction is mandated. In this paper, we propose a 5-qutrit quantum error-correcting code and provide its stabilizer formulation. Since 5 qutrits are necessary to correct a single error, our proposed code is optimal in the number of qutrits. We prove that the error model considered in this paper spans the entire $(3 \\times 3)$ operator space. Therefore, our proposed code can correct any single error on the codeword. This code outperforms the previous 9-qutrit code in (i) the number of qutrits required for encoding, (ii) our code can correct any arbitrary $(3 \\times 3)$ error, (ii) our code can readily correct bit errors in a single step as opposed to the two-step correction used previously, and (iii) phase error correction does not require correcting individual subspaces.",

    "abstract": "Efficient suppression of errors without full error correction is crucial for applications with NISQ devices. Error mitigation allows us to suppress errors in extracting expectation values without the need for any error correction code, but its applications are limited to estimating expectation values, and cannot provide us with high-fidelity quantum operations acting on arbitrary quantum states. To address this challenge, we propose to use error filtration (EF) for gate-based quantum computation, as a practical error suppression scheme without resorting to full quantum error correction. The result is a general-purpose error suppression protocol where the resources required to suppress errors scale independently of the size of the quantum operation, and does not require any logical encoding of the operation. The protocol provides error suppression whenever an error hierarchy is respected -- that is, when the ancilliary cSWAP operations are less noisy than the operation to be corrected. We further analyze the application of EF to quantum random access memory, where EF offers hardware-efficient error suppression.",

    "abstract": "Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.",

This determination is accomplished by applying ideal error correction to the encoded state which demonstrates the correctability of errors that occurred during the encoding process. We then apply single-qubit Clifford gates to the encoded state and determine the accuracy with which these gates can be applied. Finally, fault tolerant noisy error correction is applied to the encoded states in the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment allowing us to compare noisy (realistic) and perfect error correction implementations. We note that this maintains the fidelity of the encoded state for certain error-probability values. These results have implications for when non-fault tolerant procedures may be used in practical quantum computation and whether quantum error correction should be applied at every step in a quantum protocol.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction is a set of methods to protect quantum information--that is, quantum states--from unwanted environmental interactions (decoherence) and other forms of noise. The information is stored in a quantum error-correcting code, which is a subspace in a larger Hilbert space. This code is designed so that the most common errors move the state into an error space orthogonal to the original code space while preserving the information in the state. It is possible to determine whether an error has occurred by a suitable measurement and to apply a unitary correction that returns the state to the code space, without measuring (and hence disturbing) the protected state itself. In general, codewords of a quantum code are entangled states. No code that stores information can protect against all possible errors; instead, codes are designed to correct a specific error set, which should be chosen to match the most likely types of noise. An error set is represented by a set of operators that can multiply the codeword state. Quantum error correction is used to protect information in quantum communication (where quantum states pass through noisy channels) and quantum computation (where quantum states are transformed through a sequence of imperfect computational steps in the presence of environmental decoherence to solve a computational problem). In quantum computation, error correction is just one component of fault-tolerant design.",

As a result, we realize that most efficient and actively maintained simulators have been developed after 2010. We also provide a taxonomy of the most important simulation methods, namely Schrodinger-based, Feynman path integrals, Heisenberg-based, and hybrid methods. We observe that most simulators fall in the category of Schrodinger-based approaches. However, there are a few efficient simulators belonging to other categories. We also make note that quantum frameworks form their own class of software tools that provide more flexibility for algorithm designers with a choice of simulators/simulation method. Another contribution of this study includes the use and classification of optimization methods used in a variety of simulators. We observe that some state-of-the-art simulators utilize a combination of software and hardware optimization techniques to scale up the simulation of quantum circuits.

    "abstract": "While thousands of experimental physicists and chemists are currently trying to build scalable quantum computers, it appears that simulation of quantum computation will be at least as critical as circuit simulation in classical VLSI design. However, since the work of Richard Feynman in the early 1980s little progress was made in practical quantum simulation. Most researchers focused on polynomial-time simulation of restricted types of quantum circuits that fall short of the full power of quantum computation. Simulating quantum computing devices and useful quantum algorithms on classical hardware now requires excessive computational resources, making many important simulation tasks infeasible. In this work we propose a new technique for gate-level simulation of quantum circuits which greatly reduces the difficulty and cost of such simulations. The proposed technique is implemented in a simulation tool called the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) and evaluated by simulating Grover's quantum search algorithm. The back-end of our package, QuIDD Pro, is based on Binary Decision Diagrams, well-known for their ability to efficiently represent many seemingly intractable combinatorial structures. This reliance on a well-established area of research allows us to take advantage of existing software for BDD manipulation and achieve unparalleled empirical results for quantum simulation.",

However, the limitations of current NISQ devices prevents us from realising this goal today. Recently an algorithm for performing quantum simulations called quantum assisted simulator has been proposed that promises realization on current experimental devices. In this work, we extend the quantum assisted simulator to simulate the dynamics of a class of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the quantum assisted simulator is easier to implement as well as can realize multi-qubit interactions and challenging driving protocols that are difficult with other existing methods. We demonstrate this for a time-dependent Hamiltonian on the IBM Quantum Experience cloud quantum computer by showing superior performance of the quantum assisted simulator compared to Trotterization and variational quantum simulation. Further, we demonstrate the capability to simulate the dynamics of Hamiltonians consisting of 10000 qubits.

Since the flexibility offered by various controllable quantum systems has enabled to gain insight into quantum simulation of such complicated problems, analog quantum simulator has recently shown its feasibility to tackle problems of exploring topological phases. However, digital quantum simulation and detection of topological phases still remain elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally realize the digital quantum simulation of topological phase with a solid-state quantum simulator at room temperature. Distinct from previous works dealing with static topological phases, the topological phases emulated here are Floquet topological phases. Furthermore, we also illustrate the procedure of digitally simulating a quantum quench and observing the nonequilibrium dynamics of Floquet topological phases. By means of quantum quench, the 0- and {\\pi}-energy topological invariants are unambiguously detected through measuring time-averaged spin polarizations. Our experiment opens up a new avenue to digitally simulate and detect Floquet topological phases with fast-developed programmable quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations are performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled state. The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover, our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators, i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.",

It has the function of emulating the effect of noise and support more kinds of quantum operations. Second, our simulator is of high efficiency. The simulator is designed in a two-level parallel structure to be implemented efficiently on the distributed many-core Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Random quantum circuits can be simulated with 40, 75 and 200 qubits on the full, partial and single amplitude, respectively. As illustrative applications of the simulator, we present a quantum fast Poisson solver and an algorithm for quantum arithmetic of evaluating transcendental functions.

    "abstract": "With the development of topological field theory, the mathematical tool of the tensor category was also introduced into physics. Traditional group theory corresponds to a special category,group category. Tensor categories can describe higher-order interactions and symmetric relations, while group theory can only describe first-order interactions. In fact, the quantum circuit itself constitutes a category. However, at present, the field of quantum computing mainly uses group theory as a mathematical tool. If category theory is introduced into the field of quantum simulation, the application scope of quantum computers can be greatly expanded. This paper propose a new dynamic simulation method,categorical quantum simulation. In our paradigm quantum simulation is no longer based on the structure of the group theory, but based on the structure of the tensor category. This could enable many systems that could not be efficiently quantum simulated before.In this article we give an concrete example of the categorical simulation of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory. It shows that categorical quantum simulation provides a new encoding method,emergenism encoding, which saves more qubits resources than reductionism quantum encoding. In addition, many domains can be described in the language of category theory, which allows quantum circuits to directly encode and simulate these domains.",

In this paper we introduce the concept of a dedicated quantum simulator(DQS) which is an artificial system of quantum dots whose Hamiltonian maps exactly to the original many fermion problem. While the universal quantum simulator (UQS) introduced by Feynman in 1982 can simulate any quantum mechanical many-body problem, a DQS can only solve a particular many body problem. Our concept of the dedicated quantum simulator is not a quantum computer but rather a quantum \"analog\" device, dedicated to a particular quantum computation. As an example, we consider the system of the $CuO$ plane in the copper-oxide superconductors and we propose an array of electrostatically confined quantum dots to be used as its dedicated quantum simulator. We show that this dedicated device can be used to image stripe formation as a function of the electron doping using electric force microscopy. We argue that such a dedicated quantum simulator may be easier to realize in the future compared to a general purpose quantum computer.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Hamiltonian simulation, which simulates the evolution of quantum systems and probes quantum phenomena, is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that Hamiltonian-oriented analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over circuit-oriented digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming analog quantum simulators is much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware and software. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first framework for quantum Hamiltonian simulation that supports Hamiltonian programming and pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators. Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users specify the target quantum system with Hamiltonian Modeling Language, and the Hamiltonian-level programmability of analog quantum simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the abstract analog instruction set (AAIS) and programmed in AAIS Specification Language by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ generates executable pulse schedules for real devices to simulate the evolution of desired quantum systems, which is demonstrated on superconducting (IBM), neutral-atom (QuEra), and trapped-ion (IonQ) quantum devices. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of exposing the Hamiltonian-level programmability of devices with native operations or interaction-based gates and establish a small benchmark of quantum simulation to evaluate SimuQ's compiler with the above analog quantum simulators.",

Although simulating general quantum dynamics is BQP-complete, tensor networks allow efficient simulation of short-time evolution in 1D systems. However, extending these methods to higher dimensions becomes significantly challenging when the area law is violated. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing an efficient classical algorithm for simulating short-time dynamics in 2D quantum systems, utilizing cluster expansion and shallow quantum circuit simulation. Our algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including an efficient dequantization method for estimating quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates, simulating superconducting quantum computers, dequantizing quantum variational algorithms, and simulating constant-gap adiabatic quantum evolution. Our results reveal the inherent simplicity in the complexity of short-time 2D quantum dynamics and highlight the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, particularly those confined to 2D topological structures.

    "abstract": "The simulation of quantum systems is one of the flagship applications of near-term NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) computing devices. Efficiently simulating the rich, non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems remains challenging on NISQ hardware. Current simulation methods for open quantum systems employ time-stepped Trotter product formulas (\"Trotterization\") which can scale poorly with respect to the simulation time and system dimension. Here, we propose a new simulation method based on the derivation of a Kraus operator series representation of the system. We identify a class of open quantum systems for which this method produces circuits of time-independent depth, which may serve as a desirable alternative to Trotterization, especially on NISQ devices.",

Recent studies have demonstrated digital quantum simulation of open quantum systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we develop quantum circuits for optimal simulation of Markovian and Non-Markovian open quantum systems. The circuits use ancilla qubits to simulate the environment, and memory effects are induced by storing information about the system on extra qubits. We simulate the amplitude damping channel and dephasing channel as examples of the framework and infer (Non-)Markovianity from the (non-)monotonic behaviour of the dynamics. Further, we develop a method to optimize simulations by decomposing complex open quantum dynamics into smaller parts, that can be simulated using a small number of qubits. We show that this optimization reduces quantum space complexity from $O(l)$ to $O(1)$ for simulating the environment.",

In recent years, simulations of large molecules through VQE or dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians may be possible, and even able to achieve useful results with the use of error mitigation techniques. Simulating smaller models is also important, and currently, in the NISQ (Noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, it is easier and less prone to errors. This current study encompasses the theoretical background and the hardware aware circuit implementation of a quantum tunneling simulation. Specifically, this study presents the theoretical background needed for such implementation and highlights the main steps of development. Building on classic approaches of quantum tunneling simulations, this study improves the result of such simulations by employing error mitigation techniques (ZNE and REM) and uses them in conjunction with multiprogramming of the quantum chip for solving the hardware under-utilization problem that arises in such contexts. Moreover, we highlight the need for hardware-aware circuit implementations and discuss these considerations in detail to give an end-to-end workflow overview of quantum simulations.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the classical simulability of quantum circuits provides a promising avenue towards understanding the computational power of quantum systems. Whether a class of quantum circuits can be efficiently simulated with a probabilistic classical computer, or is provably hard to simulate, depends quite critically on the precise notion of \"classical simulation\" and in particular on the required accuracy. We argue that a notion of classical simulation, which we call epsilon-simulation, captures the essence of possessing \"equivalent computational power\" as the quantum system it simulates: It is statistically impossible to distinguish an agent with access to an epsilon-simulator from one possessing the simulated quantum system. We relate epsilon-simulation to various alternative notions of simulation predominantly focusing on a simulator we call a poly-box. A poly-box outputs 1/poly precision additive estimates of Born probabilities and marginals. This notion of simulation has gained prominence through a number of recent simulability results. Accepting some plausible computational theoretic assumptions, we show that epsilon-simulation is strictly stronger than a poly-box by showing that IQP circuits and unconditioned magic-state injected Clifford circuits are both hard to epsilon-simulate and yet admit a poly-box. In contrast, we also show that these two notions are equivalent under an additional assumption on the sparsity of the output distribution (poly-sparsity).",

    "abstract": "Quantum computer simulators are an indispensable tool for prototyping quantum algorithms and verifying the functioning of existing quantum computer hardware. The current largest quantum computers feature more than one thousand qubits, challenging their classical simulators. State-vector quantum simulators are challenged by the exponential increase of representable quantum states with respect to the number of qubits, making more than fifty qubits practically unfeasible. A more appealing approach for simulating quantum computers is adopting the tensor network approach, whose memory requirements fundamentally depend on the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, and allows simulating the current largest quantum computers. This work investigates and evaluates the CUDA-Q tensor network simulators on an Nvidia Grace Hopper system, particularly the Matrix Product State (MPS) formulation. We compare the performance of the CUDA-Q state vector implementation and validate the correctness of MPS simulations. Our results highlight that tensor network-based methods provide a significant opportunity to simulate large-qubit circuits, albeit approximately. We also show that current GPU-accelerated computation cannot fully utilize GPU efficiently in the case of MPS simulations.",

Our proposed toolchain encodes quantum amplitudes and noise probabilities in a probabilistic graphical model, and it compiles the circuits to logical formulas that support efficient repeated simulation of and sampling from quantum circuits for different parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art state vector and density matrix quantum circuit simulators, our simulation approach offers greater performance when sampling from noisy circuits with at least eight to 20 qubits and with around 12 operations on each qubit, making the approach ideal for simulating near-term variational quantum algorithms.

    "abstract": "Trotterization-based, iterative approaches to quantum simulation are restricted to simulation times less than the coherence time of the quantum computer, which limits their utility in the near term. Here, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), for decreasing the quantum circuit depth of quantum simulations. VFF seeks an approximate diagonalization of a short-time simulation to enable longer-time simulations using a constant number of gates. Our error analysis provides two results: (1) the simulation error of VFF scales at worst linearly in the fast-forwarded simulation time, and (2) our cost function's operational meaning as an upper bound on average-case simulation error provides a natural termination condition for VFF. We implement VFF for the Hubbard, Ising, and Heisenberg models on a simulator. Additionally, we implement VFF on Rigetti's quantum computer to demonstrate simulation beyond the coherence time. Finally, we show how to estimate energy eigenvalues using VFF.",

    "abstract": "Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most important applications of quantum computers. Traditional approaches for quantum simulation involve preparing the full evolved state of the system and then measuring some physical quantity. Here, we present a different and novel approach to quantum simulation that uses a compressed quantum state that we call the ``shadow state''. The amplitudes of this shadow state are proportional to the time-dependent expectations of a specific set of operators of interest, and it evolves according to its own Schr\\\"odinger equation. This evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer efficiently under broad conditions. Applications of this approach to quantum simulation problems include simulating the dynamics of exponentially large systems of free fermions or free bosons, the latter example recovering a recent algorithm for simulating exponentially many classical harmonic oscillators. These simulations are hard for classical methods and also for traditional quantum approaches, as preparing the full states would require exponential resources. Shadow Hamiltonian simulation can also be extended to simulate expectations of more complex operators such as two-time correlators or Green's functions, and to study the evolution of operators themselves in the Heisenberg picture.",

It allows the study of quantum systems that cannot be efficiently simulated on classical computers. While a universal quantum computer is also a quantum simulator, only particular systems have been simulated up to now. Still, there is a wealth of successful cases, such as spin models, quantum chemistry, relativistic quantum physics and quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to design a quantum simulator for the Majorana equation, a non-Hamiltonian relativistic wave equation that might describe neutrinos and other exotic particles beyond the standard model. The simulation demands the implementation of charge conjugation, an unphysical operation that opens a new front in quantum simulations, including the discrete symmetries associated with complex conjugation and time reversal. Finally, we show how to implement this general method in trapped ions.",

Digital quantum simulations offer greater universality and flexibility over analog simulations. However, digital quantum simulations of open quantum systems face a theoretical challenge; one does not know the solutions of the continuous time master equation for developing quantum gate operators. We give a theoretical framework for digital quantum simulation of ENAQT by introducing new quantum evolution operators. We develop the dynamical equation for the operators and prove that it is an analytical solution of the master equation. As an example, using the dynamical equations, we simulate the FMO complex in the digital setting, reproducing theoretical and experimental evidence of the dynamics. The framework gives an optimal method for {quantum circuit} implementation, giving a log reduction in complexity over known methods. The generic framework can be extrapolated to study other open quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and programming models on noisy near-term quantum hardware has begun. As hybrid programs scale towards classical intractability, validation and benchmarking are critical to understanding the utility of the hybrid computational model. In this paper, we demonstrate a newly developed quantum circuit simulator based on tensor network theory that enables intermediate-scale verification and validation of hybrid quantum-classical computing frameworks and programming models. We present our tensor-network quantum virtual machine (TNQVM) simulator which stores a multi-qubit wavefunction in a compressed (factorized) form as a matrix product state, thus enabling single-node simulations of larger qubit registers, as compared to brute-force state-vector simulators. Our simulator is designed to be extensible in both the tensor network form and the classical hardware used to run the simulation (multicore, GPU, distributed). The extensibility of the TNQVM simulator with respect to the simulation hardware type is achieved via a pluggable interface for different numerical backends (e.g., ITensor and ExaTENSOR numerical libraries). We demonstrate the utility of our TNQVM quantum circuit simulator through the verification of randomized quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, both expressed within the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) programming model.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen unprecedented advance in the design and control of quantum computers. Nonetheless, their applicability is still restricted and access remains expensive. Therefore, a substantial amount of quantum algorithms research still relies on simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware. However, due to the sheer complexity of simulating real quantum computers, many simulators unrealistically simplify the problem and instead simulate perfect quantum hardware, i.e., they do not consider errors caused by the fragile nature of quantum systems. Stochastic quantum simulation provides a conceptually suitable solution to this problem: physically motivated errors are applied in a probabilistic fashion throughout the simulation. In this work, we propose to use decision diagrams, as well as concurrent executions, to substantially reduce resource-requirements-which are still daunting-for stochastic quantum circuit simulation. Backed up by rigorous theory, empirical studies show that this approach allows for a substantially faster and much more scalable simulation for certain quantum circuits.",

It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.",

    "abstract": "Quantum repeaters with multiple quantum memories provide high throughput, low latency, and high fidelity quantum state (qubit) transfer over long distances. However, conventional quantum repeater protocols require full connections among the multiple quantum memories in a repeater node, which is technically challenging. Here, we propose a quantum repeater protocol based on backward propagating photon emission and absorption, where the quantum memories are multiplexed in the time-domain to speed up a single transmission channel without requiring full connectivity, drastically facilitating physical implementation. Although the protocol is described with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, it is applicable to various physical systems and opens up the possibility of high-speed high-fidelity quantum networks for distributed quantum computation and quantum Internet.",

Since quantum operations include as special cases quantum states, effects, and measurements, quantum supermaps describe all possible transformations between elementary quantum objects (quantum systems as well as quantum devices). After giving the axiomatic definition of supermap, we prove a realization theorem, which shows that any supermap can be physically implemented as a simple quantum circuit. Applications to quantum programming, cloning, discrimination, estimation, information-disturbance trade-off, and tomography of channels are outlined.",

This quantity, known as the quantum circuit complexity, is a fundamental property of quantum evolutions that has widespread applications in many fields, including quantum computation, quantum field theory, and black hole physics. In this letter, we obtain a new lower bound for the quantum circuit complexity in terms of a novel complexity measure that we propose for quantum circuits, which we call the quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proposed measure is based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order one (also called the quantum earth mover's distance), a metric on the space of quantum states. We also prove several fundamental and important properties of our new complexity measure, which stand to be of independent interest. Finally, we show that our new measure also provides a lower bound for the experimental cost of implementing quantum circuits, which implies a quantum limit on converting quantum resources to computational resources. Our results provide novel applications of the quantum Wasserstein distance and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the resources needed to implement a quantum computation.",

In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at the first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.",

By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g2(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.",

However, the exotic quantum phenomena are typically observable only in rare material systems under extreme experimental conditions.

Here we review our recent efforts on first-principles exploration of novel quantum physics and materials, focusing on emergent quantum phenomena induced by spin-orbit coupling and its interplay with magnetism, topology and superconductivity. The first-principles material design guided by fundamental theory enables the discoveries of several key quantum materials, including next-generation magnetic topological insulators, high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, and unconventional superconductors.

However, their rational design is not well established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions, which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction. Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including NiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D materials and other functional materials.",

    "abstract": "Hexagonal oxide perovskites, in contrast to the more familiar perovskites, allow for face-sharing of metal-oxygen octahedra or trigonal prisms within their structural frameworks. This results in dimers, trimers, tetramers, or longer fragments of chains of face-sharing octahedra in the crystal structures, and consequently in much shorter metal-metal distances and lower metal-oxygen-metal bond angles than are seen in the more familiar perovskites. The presence of the face-sharing octahedra can have a dramatic impact on magnetic properties of these compounds, and dimer-based materials, in particular, have been the subjects of many quantum-materials-directed studies in materials physics. Hexagonal oxide perovskites are of contemporary interest due to their potential for geometrical frustration of the ordering of magnetic moments or orbital occupancies at low temperatures, which is especially relevant to their significance as quantum materials. As such, several hexagonal oxide perovskites have been identified as potential candidates for hosting the quantum spin liquid state at low temperatures. In our view, hexagonal oxide perovskites are fertile ground for finding new quantum materials. This review briefly describes the solid state chemistry of many of these materials.",

This exponentially reduces the time and resources necessary for computations. QML accelerates materials research with active screening of chemical space, identifying novel materials for practical applications and classifying structurally diverse materials given their measured properties. This study analyzes the performance of three efficient quantum machine learning algorithms viz., variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) for the classification of transition metal chalcogenides and oxides (TMCs &TMOs). The analysis is performed on three datasets of different sizes containing 102, 192 and 350 materials with TMCs and TMOs labelled as +1 and -1 respectively. By employing feature selection, classical machine learning achieves 100% accuracy whereas QML achieves the highest performance of 99% and 98% for test and train data respectively on QSVC. This study establishes the competence of QML models in materials classification and explores the quantum circuits in terms of over-fitting using the circuit descriptors expressibility and entangling capability. In addition, the perspectives on QML in materials research with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices is given.",

These devices and materials reside in the fascinating transition regime between quantum mechanics and classical physics.   The devices are designed such that a nonreciprocal unitary state evolution is achieved by means of a broken inversion symmetry, for example as induced at material interfaces. This coherent state evolution is interrupted by individual inelastic scattering events caused by defects coupled to an environment.   Two-terminal non-unitary quantum devices, for example, feature nonreciprocal conductance in linear response. Thus, they are exemptions to Onsager's reciprocal relation, and they challenge the second law of thermodynamics.

Fine-tuned on a text-mined synthesis database, our model raises accuracy from under 40% with pretrained models, to under 80% using conventional fine-tuning, and further to around 90% with our proposed generalized Tanimoto similarity, while maintaining robust to additional synthesis steps. Our model further demonstrates comparable performance across materials with varying degrees of quantumness quantified using quantum weight, indicating that LLMs offer a powerful tool to predict balanced chemical equations for quantum materials discovery.",

While it has been shown that such a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic structure problems and idealized model Hamiltonians, the highly relevant problem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a prohibitive amount of resources. Here, we show that by using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum computer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms, the electronic structure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a quantum computer. In our approach, the quantum computer solves a small effective quantum impurity problem that is self-consistently determined via a feedback loop between the quantum and classical computation. Use of a quantum computer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known classical algorithm, and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to be resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical qubits becomes available.",

    "abstract": "To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.",

    "abstract": "Substrate material imperfections and surface losses are one of the major factors limiting superconducting quantum circuitry from reaching the scale and complexity required to build a practicable quantum computer. One potential path towards higher coherence of superconducting quantum devices is to explore new substrate materials with a reduced density of imperfections due to inherently different surface chemistries. Here, we examine two ternary metal oxide materials, spinel (MgAl2O4) and lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3), with a focus on surface and interface characterization and preparation. Devices fabricated on LaAlO3 have quality factors three times higher than earlier devices, which we attribute to a reduction in interfacial disorder. MgAl2O4 is a new material in the realm of superconducting quantum devices and, even in the presence of significant surface disorder, consistently outperforms LaAlO3. Our results highlight the importance of materials exploration, substrate preparation, and characterization to identify materials suitable for high-performance superconducting quantum circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Quantum memories are essential for quantum repeaters that will form the backbone of the future quantum internet. Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have applied a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network.",

Yet, first-principles evaluation of charged defect energetics in 2D materials typically do not include substrates due to the high computational cost. We present a general continuum model approach to incorporate substrate effects directly in density-functional theory calculations of charged defects in the 2D material alone. We show that this technique accurately predicts charge defect energies compared to much more expensive explicit substrate calculations, but with the computational expediency of calculating defects in free-standing 2D materials. Using this technique, we rapidly predict the substantial modification of charge transition levels of two defects in MoS$_2$ and ten defects promising for quantum technologies in hBN, due to SiO$_2$ and diamond substrates. This establishes a foundation for high-throughput computational screening of new quantum defects in 2D materials that critically accounts for substrate effects.",

Recent developments suggest that taking one more step down in dimensionality - from monolayer, atomic sheets to individual atomic chains - can bring exciting prospects as the ultimate limit in material downscaling is reached while establishing an entirely new field of one-dimensional quantum materials. Here we review this emerging area of one-dimensional van der Waals quantum materials and anticipate its future directions. We focus on quantum effects associated with the charge-density-wave condensate, strongly-correlated phenomena, topological phases, and other unique physical characteristics, which are attainable specifically in van der Waals materials of lower dimensionality. Possibilities for engineering the properties of quasi-one-dimensional materials via compositional changes, vacancies, and defects, as well as the prospects of their applications in composites are also discussed.",

The model could help resolve the cosmological paradox associated to the zero-point energy of electromagnetic fields, while reclaiming quantum effects associated with quantum vacuum such as the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift; it also offers a new insight into the Zitterbewegung of material particles.",

Through a method grounded in site-symmetry principles, we devise a comprehensive workflow to pinpoint potential native quantum defects across the entire spectrum of known binary 2D materials. Leveraging both symmetry principles and data-driven approaches markedly enhances the identification of spin defects exhibiting triplet ground states. This advancement is pivotal in discovering NV-like quantum defects in 2D materials, which are instrumental in facilitating a set of quantum functionalities. For discerning the multifaceted functionalities of these quantum defect candidates, their magneto-optical properties are comprehensively estimated using high-throughput computations. Our findings underscore that antisite defects in diverse hosts emerge as prospective quantum defects of significance. Crucially, based on our research, we advocate that the 16 antisites present in post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMCs) stand out as a prominent 2D-material-based quantum defect platforms, by their precise defect levels, optimal magneto-optical attributes, and the readily accessible nature of their host materials.

    "abstract": "Optical signals obtained by the material response to classical laser fields are given by nonlinear response functions which can be expressed by sums over various quantum pathways of matter. We show that some pathways can be selected by using nonclassical fields, through the entanglement of photon and material pathways, which results in a different-power law dependence on the incoming field intensity. Spectrally overlapping stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and two-photon-absorption (TPA) pathways in a pump probe experiment are separated by controlling the degree of entanglement of pairs of incoming photons. Pathway-selectivity opens up new avenues for mapping photon into material entanglement. New material information, otherwise erased by interferences among pathways, is revealed.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers hold promise to enable efficient simulations of the properties of molecules and materials; however, at present they only permit ab initio calculations of a few atoms, due to a limited number of qubits. In order to harness the power of near-term quantum computers for simulations of larger systems, it is desirable to develop hybrid quantum-classical methods where the quantum computation is restricted to a small portion of the system. This is of particular relevance for molecules and solids where an active region requires a higher level of theoretical accuracy than its environment. Here we present a quantum embedding theory for the calculation of strongly-correlated electronic states of active regions, with the rest of the system described within density functional theory. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach by investigating several defect quantum bits in semiconductors that are of great interest for quantum information technologies. We perform calculations on quantum computers and show that they yield results in agreement with those obtained with exact diagonalization on classical architectures, paving the way to simulations of realistic materials on near-term quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of high-dielectric materials is crucial to increasing the efficiency of electronic devices and batteries. Here, we report three previously unexplored materials with very high dielectric constants (69 $<$ $\\epsilon$ $<$ 101) and large band gaps (2.9$<$ $E_{\\text{g}}$(eV) $<$ 5.5) obtained by screening materials databases using statistical optimization algorithms aided by artificial neural networks (ANN). Two of these new dielectrics are mixed-anion compounds (Eu$_5$SiCl$_6$O$_4$ and HoClO), and are shown to be thermodynamically stable against common semiconductors via phase-diagram analysis. We also uncovered four other materials with relatively large dielectric constants (20$<$$\\epsilon$$<$40) and band gaps (2.3$<$$E_{\\text{g}}$(eV)$<$2.7). While the ANN training data is obtained from Materials Project, the search-space consists of materials from Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) - demonstrating a successful implementation of cross-database materials design. Overall, we report dielectric properties of 17 materials calculated using ab-initio calculations, that were selected in our design workflow.

The decoherence of quantum states restricts the capability of building quantum simulators and quantum computers in a scalable fashion. Meanwhile, the topological phase is found inherently capable of protecting physical fields from unavoidable fabrication-induced disorder, which inspires the potential application of topological protection on quantum states. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of topologically protected quantum polarization entangled states on a photonic chip. The process tomography shows that quantum entanglement can be well preserved by the boundary states even when the chip material substantially introduces relative polarization rotation in phase space. Our work links topology, material and quantum physics, opening the door to wide applications of topological enhancement in genuine quantum regime.",

    "title": "Accelerating quantum materials development with advances in transmission electron microscopy",
    "abstract": "Quantum materials are driving a technology revolution in sensing, communication, and computing, while simultaneously testing many core theories of the past century. Materials such as topological insulators, complex oxides, quantum dots, color center hosting semiconductors, and other types of strongly correlated materials can exhibit exotic properties such as edge conductivity, multiferroicity, magnetoresistance, single photon emission, and optical-spin locking. These emergent properties arise and depend strongly on the materials detailed atomic scale structure, including atomic defects, dopants, and lattice stacking. In this review, after introduction of different classes of quantum materials and quantum excitations, we describe how progress in the field of electron microscopy, including in situ and in operando EM, can accelerate advances in quantum materials. Our review describes EM methods including: i) principles and operation modes of EM, ii) EM spectroscopies, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence, and electron energy gain spectroscopy, iii) 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, iv) dynamic and ultrafast EM, v) complimentary ultrafast spectroscopies, and vi) atomic electron tomography. We discuss how these methods inform structure function relations in quantum materials down to the picometer scale and femtosecond time resolution, and how they enable high resolution manipulation of quantum materials. Among numerous results, our review highlights how EM has enabled identification of the 3D structure of quantum defects, measuring reversible and metastable dynamics of quantum excitations, mapping exciton states and single photon emission, measuring nanoscale thermal transport and coupled excitation dynamics, and measuring the internal electric field of quantum heterointerfaces, all at the quantum materials intrinsic atomic and near atomic-length scale.",

The main idea is that many results of the method of complex germ and of perturbative quantum field theory can be made more simple and natural if instead of the algebra of (pseudo)differential operators one uses the Weyl algebra (operators with Weyl symbols) with the Moyal *-product. Section 1, devoted to quantum mechanics, contains a closed mathematical description of the Maslov--Shvedov method in the theory of Schrodinger equation, including the method of canonical operator. In particular, it contains a new simple definition of the Maslov index modulo 4. Section 2, devoted to quantum field theory, contains a logically self-consistent exposition of the main results of perturbative quantum field theory not using the subtraction of infinities from the quantum Hamiltonian of free field and normal ordering of operators. It also contains a result (dynamical evolution in quantum field theory in quasiclassical approximation) close to the Maslov--Shvedov quantum field theory complex germ.",

This unites all known such approaches in one and the same theory, and we show that many of the known results such as no-cloning, no-deleting, quantum teleportation and super-dense quantum coding, which are known in classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ and in some MQTs, hold for any General Quantum Theory. On the other hand, in many General Quantum Theories, a geometrical object which we call \"quantum kernel\" arises, which is invariant under the unitary group $\\mathbf{U}(V,\\varphi)$, and which carries the geometry of a so-called polar space. We use this object to construct new quantum (teleportation) coding schemes, which mix quantum theory with the geometry of the quantum kernel (and the action of the unitary group). We also show that in characteristic $0$, every General Quantum Theory over an algebraically closed field behaves like classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ at many levels, and that all such theories share one model, which we pin down as the \"minimal model,\" which is countable and defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Moreover, to make the analogy with classical Quantum Theory even more striking, we show that Born's rule holds in any such theory. So all such theories are not modal at all. Finally, we obtain an extension theory for General Quantum Theories in characteristic $0$ which allows one to extend any such theory over algebraically closed fields (such as classical complex Quantum Theory) to larger theories in which a quantum kernel is present.",

Such a theory is described on the configuration space of fields rather than spacetime, which is a third quantized theory. So, both string theory and group field theory are third-quantized theories. Thus, using axioms of string field theory, we motivate similar axioms for group field theory. Then, using the structure of these axioms for string field theory and group field theory, we identify general features of axioms for any such third quantized theory of quantum gravity. Thus, we show that such third-quantized theories of quantum gravity can be formulated as formal axiomatic systems. We then analyze the consequences of G\\\"odel theorems on such third quantized theories. We thus address problems of consistency and completeness of any third quantized theories of quantum gravity.",

    "abstract": "Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.",

    "abstract": "In this thesis we study the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave interpretation of quantum theory. We consider the domain of non-relativistic quantum theory, relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory, and in each domain we consider the possibility of formulating a pilot-wave interpretation. For non-relativistic quantum theory a pilot-wave interpretation in terms of particle beables can readily be formulated. But this interpretation can in general not straightforwardly be generalized to relativistic wave equations. The problems which prevent us from devising a pilot-wave interpretation for relativistic wave equations also plague the standard quantum mechanical interpretation, where these problems led to the conception of quantum field theory. Therefore most of our attention is focussed on the construction of a pilot-wave interpretation for quantum field theory. We thereby favour the field beable approach, developed amongst others by Bohm, Hiley, Holland, Kaloyerou and Valentini. Although the field beable approach can be successfully applied to bosonic quantum field theory, it seems not straightforward to do so for fermionic quantum field theory.",

In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.",

    "abstract": "We show how continuous matrix product states of quantum field theories can be described in terms of the dissipative non-equilibrium dynamics of a lower-dimensional auxiliary boundary field theory. We demonstrate that the spatial correlation functions of the bulk field can be brought into one-to-one correspondence with the temporal statistics of the quantum jumps of the boundary field. This equivalence: (1) illustrates an intimate connection between the theory of continuous quantum measurement and quantum field theory; (2) gives an explicit construction of the boundary field theory allowing the extension of real-space renormalization group methods to arbitrary dimensional quantum field theories without the introduction of a lattice parameter; and (3) yields a novel interpretation of recent cavity QED experiments in terms of quantum field theory, and hence paves the way toward observing genuine quantum phase transitions in such zero-dimensional driven quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Quantum feedback networks have been introduced in quantum optics as a set of rules for constructing arbitrary networks of quantum mechanical systems connected by uni-directional quantum optical fields, and has allowed for a system theoretic approach to open quantum optics systems. Our aim here is to establish a network theory for quantum transport systems where typically the mediating fields between systems are bi-directional. Mathematically this leads us to study quantum feedback networks where fields arrive at ports in input-output pairs, which is then just a specially case of the uni-directional theory. However, it is conceptually important to develop this theory in the context of quantum transport theory, and the resulting theory extends traditional approaches which tends to view the components in quantum transport as scatterers for the various fields, in the process allows us to consider emission and absorption of field quanta by these components. The quantum feedback network theory is applicable to both Bose and Fermi fields, moreover it applies to nonlinear dynamics for the component systems. In this first paper on the subject, we advance the general theory, but study the case of linear passive quantum components in some detail.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that quantum field theory arises by applying ordinary quantum mechanics to the low energy effective degrees of freedom of a more fundamental theory defined at ultra-high-energy/short-wavelength scales. We shall argue here that, even for free quantum fields, there are holistic aspects of quantum field theory that cannot be properly understood in this manner. Specifically, the ``subtractions'' needed to define nonlinear polynomial functions of a free quantum field in curved spacetime are quite simple and natural from the quantum field theoretic point of view, but are at best extremely ad hoc and unnatural if viewed as independent renormalizations of individual modes of the field. We illustrate this point by contrasting the analysis of the Casimir effect, the renormalization of the stress-energy tensor in time-dependent spacetimes, and anomalies from the point of quantum field theory and from the point of view of quantum mechanics applied to the independent low energy modes of the field. Some implications for the cosmological constant problem are discussed.",

We discuss how these models converge to a discrete spacetime version of quantum field theory. We first define toy fermion, boson and mixed fermion-boson free quantum fields. The free fields are employed to form what we consider to be the simplest examples of interacting fields which we then use to construct Hamiltonian densities. Scattering operators are defined in terms of these densities and are employed to construct scattering probabilities. Although our definition of a scattering operator is not the usual \"second-quantization\" definition we believe it is simpler and more natural. Emphasis is placed on finding the eigenstructures of toy quantum fields.",

    "abstract": "In this series of papers, we propose a new rendition of 3d and 4d state sum models based upon the group field theory (GFT) approach to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We will see that the group field theories investigated in the literature to date are, when judged from the position of quantum field theory, an unusual manifestation of quantum dynamics. They are one in which the Hadamard function for the field theory propagates a-causally the physical degrees of freedom of quantum gravity. This is fine if we wish to define a scalar product on the physical state space, but it is not what we generally think of as originating directly from a field theory. We propose a model in 3d more in line with standard quantum field theory, and therefore the field theory precipitates causal dynamics. Thereafter, we couple the model to point matter, and extract from the GFT the effective non-commutative field theory describing the matter dynamics on a quantum gravity background. We identify the symmetries of our new model and clarify their meaning in the GFT setting. We are aided in this process by identifying the category theory foundations of this GFT which, moreover, propel us towards a categorified version for the 4d case.",
